### Howdy, I'm Cody! :wave:

I’m a Senior Manager and Sr Staff Engineer at Confluent, which sets your data in motion :rocket:. I joined as part of the "tiger team" to build 
and launch Confluent Cloud, the leading Kafka- and Confluent-as-a-Service solution. As the company grows, I help identify new critical areas 
and bootstrap teams/solutions to address them (cross-cloud/multi-k8s orchestration, CLI/API/API/TF, internal developer platforms).

Here's how I like to spend my time:

- :two_men_holding_hands: Technical Leadership - Aligning teams/software to increase productivity, champion for UX-first design and API spec-first development, designing scalable/secure/resilient SaaS architectures
- :cloud: Devops - Cloud (AWS, GCP, ~Azure~), Kubernetes, Kafka, Elastic, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, Zookeeper. Programmatically building, managing, scaling, destroying infra.
- :robot: Software Development - Building microservices in Golang, Java, and Python using REST, GRPC, and Kafka event-driven comms
- :notebook: Service Architecture - Shaping the way that we build scalable and reliable systems, and providing platform foundations for service communication, authN/authZ, feature flags, dynamic configs, rate limits/quotas, API design, etc. across all of Engineering.
